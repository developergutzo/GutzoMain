# Global Rules

You must always consider the context from the following SQL files when answering
questions or performing tasks involving database schema, data flow, or backend
logic:

- `nodebackend/SupabaseSelfhostSqlFiles/backup.sql`

If any other `.sql` files are added to the project, please consider them as well
particularly when making changes to the database or understanding the data
model.

# File Creation Rules

Any new SQL files created should be placed in this `DBFolder` directory.

# Environment Variable Rules

Do not add fallbacks/defaults for `process.env` variables (e.g.,
`process.env.VAR || 'default'`). Let the application fail if the variable is
missing.

# Code Quality Rules

Do not use hardcoded fallbacks for data display (e.g.,
`data.field || 'Default String'`). UI should handle missing data gracefully
(e.g., hide element, show skeleton) or the data must be guaranteed by the API.

# STRICT CODING RULES

## 1. No Lazy Fallbacks

- **NEVER** use default fallback strings or numbers for critical data.
- **FORBIDDEN**: `|| "9999999999"`, `|| "Bengaluru"`, `|| "User"`,
  `|| "Customer"`, `|| "Vendor Outlet"`, `|| 0`.
- **REQUIRED**: If data is missing (undefined/null), the application MUST fail
  explicitly or handle the null case gracefully (e.g., show an error, disable
  the button). DO NOT mask the issue with fake data.
- This applies to: Phone numbers, Addresses, Names, Locations, ETAs, Prices.
